# UnitTests4Bitwig
Some unit tests for the Bitwig Studio API. Only properties are tested.

## Exexuting the tests

1) Open the included project "UnitTestsProject" project in Bitwig.
2) Open the script console to see the results of test logs.
3) Add the extension "Moss -> Unit Tests (by Jürgen Moßgraber)" in the controller settings page.
4) To not get flooded with log messages run each test separately and turn off detailed logging.
5) To re-run with new settings, switch the extension off and on again.
